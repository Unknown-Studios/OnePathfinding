# ------------ About ------------

OnePathfinding is a pathfinding system using the A* algorithm
to find the best possible way from point A to point B. 
OnePathfinding is using systems like Queueing for better 
performance on the go. Its examples contains advanced detection
systems, these being Audio, Smelling and Viewing detection.

# ------------ Setup ------------

1.	Create a terrain for the objects to move on.
 
2.	Create an empty gameobject, this gameobject will work as your manager. 
	Make sure that you are never going to end up with two of these components.
	
3.	Attach the GridManager script from 
	Plugins/OnePathfinding/Core/GridManager.cs
	or
	use the already setup prefab called GameController under 
	Plugins/OnePathfinding/Prefab/GameController.prefab

3.5. (Optional) Attach the AISpawner component to the GameController, 
	this can be used for spawning AIs with ease. You can then use the AISpawner.Spawn() 
	function to spawn animals, for an example on spawning these try taking a look at the 
	test.cs in Plugins/OnePathfinding/Scene/
	

4.	Create a grid by clicking on Add Grid on the gridmanager component, 
	then fill out the options for it.
	
5.	Attach the AdvancedAI or SimpleAI scripts to the 
	object you want to become an AI gameobject.

6.	If you added the AISpawner and Test script the 
	AIs should spawn and begin to move around, when the 
	game is started.

If the steps was followed correctly, the AI should be 
moving by now. If this isn't the case, please contact 
us. Support information can be found further down in 
this file.

# ------------ File Description ------------
This is a description of each of the main files, descriping what the file does and how to use it:

GridManager.cs:
	This file is used for managing a list of grids
	and changing the options for every grid. It's 
	important that there isn't two of this component
	in one scene.
	
Pathfinding.cs:
	This file contains the namespace that is used for
	finding the path. This file should not be edited
	unless you know what you are doing. This namespace
	should be used in every script that is going to use
	the pathfinding algorithms.
	
SimpleAI.cs:
	This file is used mainly for learning purposes, you
	attach this file to a gameobject and drag another 
	active gameobject to the target variable. When the game
	is started it will move towards the gameobject "target"
	
AdvancedAI.cs:
	This file is the main example, this file contains the out
	of the box detection system, this script can be used for 
	further learning the API.
	
AntiFly.cs:
	This file is used to prevent the AI from going off the
	terrain. This file doesn't have any variables and just
	needs to be attached to the gameobject to work.
	
Wind.cs:
	This file will be added automatically added with 
	gridmanager, it has 1 variable:
		Repeat Rate: The repeat rate is how often the 
		wind direction is updated in seconds. So if it 
		is 30 it will update the direction of the wind
		every 30 seconds.
		
AudioScript.cs:
	The audioscript is used to attach to the external 
	audio sources that is going to affect the AIs.
	
AIData.cs:
	This script is used for holding all of the AIs data.
	This is Health, hunger and home location(Spawn Location)
	
Documentation for these files will be added to the website shortly.
