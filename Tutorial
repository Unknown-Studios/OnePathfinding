# Setup:

1.	Create a terrain for the objects to move on.
 
2.	Create an empty gameobject, this gameobject will work as your manager. 
	Make sure that you are never going to end up with two of these components.
	
3.	Attach the GridManager script from Plugins/OnePathfinding/Core/GridManager.cs
	or
	use the already setup prefab called GameController under Plugins/OnePathfinding/Prefab/GameController.prefab

3.5. (Optional) Attach the AISpawner component to the GameController, 
	this can be used for spawning AIs with ease.

4.	Create a grid by clicking on Add Grid on the gridmanager component, 
	then fill out the options for it.
	
5.	Attach the AdvancedAI or SimpleAI scripts to the ai gameobject.

5.5. If you added AISpawner you should also add Test or write your own script that uses the AISpawner.

6.	The AI's should spawn and begin to move around.

If the steps was followed correctly, the AI should be moving by now, if you have any problems please write on the forum post:

If you want to write your own component start by taking a look at SimpleAI, and as you advance move to the advancedAI.
